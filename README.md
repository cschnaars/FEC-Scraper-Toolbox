# FEC Scraper Toolbox
The FEC Scraper Toolbox is a series of Python modules you can use to
find and download electronically filed campaign finance reports housed
on the Federal Election Commission website and load those reports into
a database manager.

Generally, the FEC Scraper Toolbox is meant to replace the [FEC Scraper](https://github.com/cschnaars/FEC-Scraper)
repository.  You might want to use the older repository, however, if
you want to limit the scope of your database to include only specific
committees.  The default behavior of the FEC Scraper Toolbox is to
download every available report whereas FEC Scraper downloads reports
only for the committees you specify.

Presently, the Toolbox consists of three major modules. They are
documented fully below, but in brief, they are:
* __download_reports:__ Downloads daily compilations of electronically
filed reports and consumes an RSS feed to find and download
recently filed reports.
* __parse_reports:__ Combines any number of reports into a single file
for each form type (Schedule A, Schedule B and so on).  Report header
information is loaded into a database.
* __update_master_files:__ Downloads weekly master files housing
detailed information about all candidates and committees, individual
contributions and contributions from committees to candidates and
other committees.

FEC Scraper Toolbox has been developed and tested under Python 2.7.4.

## Requirements
The following modules are required to use FEC Scraper Toolbox. All of
them are included with a standard Python 2.7.4 installation:
* csv
* datetime
* ftplib
* glob
* linecache
* multiprocessing
* os
* pickle
* pyodbc
* re
* shutil
* time
* urllib
* urllib2
* zipfile

## User Settings
You can add an optional usersettings.py file to the directory housing
your Python modules to customize database connection strings and file
locations. In each module, you'll see a try statement, where the module
will attempt to load this file.  Default values can be specified in the
except portion of the try statement.

You can copy and paste the text below into your usersettings.py file,
then specify the values you want to use.

```python
    ARCPROCDIR = '' # Directory to house archives that have been processed
    ARCSVDIR = '' # Directory to house archives that have been downloaded but not processed
    DBCONNSTR = '' # Database connection string
    MASTERDIR = '' # Master directory for weekly candidate and committee master files
    RPTERRDIR = '' # Directory to house error logs generated when a field can't be parsed
    RPTHOLDDIR = '' # Directory to house electronically filed reports that cannot be processed
    RPTOUTDIR = '' # Directory to house data files generated by parse_reports
    RPTPROCDIR = '' # Directory to house electronically filed reports that have been processed
    RPTRVWDIR = '' # Directory to house electronically filed reports that could not be imported and need to be reviewed
    RPTSVDIR = '' # Directory to house electronically filed reports that have been downloaded but not processed
```

## download_reports Module
This module tracks and downloads all electronically filed reports
housed on the Federal Election Commission website.  Specifically, it
ensures all daily archives of reports (which go back to 2001) have been
downloaded and extracted.  It then consumes the FEC's RSS feed listing
all reports filed within the past seven days to look for new reports.

Electronic reports filed voluntarily by a handful of Senators presently
are not included here.

This module does not load any data or otherwise interact with a
database manager (though I plan to add functionality to ping a database
to build a list of previously downloaded reports rather than require
the user to warehouse them).  Its sole purpose is to track and download
reports.

If you don't want to download archives back to 2001 or otherwise want
to manually control what is downloaded, you'll find commented out code
below as well as in the module that you can use to modify the zipinfo.p
pickle (which is described in the first bullet point below).

This module goes through the following process in this order:
* Uses the pickle module to attempt to load zipinfo.p, a dictionary
    housing the name of the most recent archive downloaded as well as a
    list of files not downloaded previously.  Commented out code available
    below and in the module can be used to modify this pickle if you
    want to control which archives will be retrieved.
* Calls build_prior_archive_list to construct a list of archives that
    already have been downloaded and saved to ARCPROCDIR or ARCSVDIR.  
    __NOTE:__ I plan to deprecate this function.  I added this feature for
    development and to test the implementation of the zipinfo.p pickle.
    Using the pickle saves a lot of time and disk space compared to
    warehousing all the archives.
* Calls build_archive_download_list, which processes the zipinfo.p
    pickle to build a list of available archive files that have not
    been downloaded.
* Uses multiprocessing and calls download_archive to download each
    archive file.  These files are saved in the directory specified
    with the ARCSVDIR variable.  After downloading an archive, the
    subroutine compares the length of the downloaded file with the length
    of the source file.  If the lengths do not match, the file is deleted
    from the file system.  The subroutine tries to download a file up to
    five times.  
    __NOTE:__ You can set the NUMPROC variable in the user variables section
    to specify the number of downloads that occur simultaneously.  The
    default value is 10.
* Uses multiprocessing and calls unzip_archive to extract any files in
    the archive that have not been downloaded previously.  The second
    parameter is an overwrite flag; existing files are overwritten when
    this flag is set to 1.  Default is 0.  
    __NOTE:__ You can set the NUMPROC variable in the user variables section
    to specify the number of downloads that occur simultaneously.  The
    default value is 10.
* Again calls build_prior_archive_list to reconstruct the list of
    archives that already have been downloaded and saved to ARCPROCDIR or
    ARCSVDIR.  
    __NOTE:__ As stated above, this feature is slated for deprecation.
* Calls pickle_archives to rebuild zipinfo.p and save it to the same
    directory as this module.
* Calls build_prior_report_list to build a list of reports housed in
    RPTHOLDDIR, RPTPROCDIR and RPTSVDIR.  
    __NOTE:__ I plan to add a function that can build a list of previously
    processed files using a database call rather than combing the file
    system (though it will remain necessary to look in the RPTHOLDDIR and
    RPTSVDIR directories to find files that have not been loaded into the
    database).
* Calls consume_rss, which uses a regular expression to scan an FEC RSS
    feed listing all electronically filed reports submitted within the
    past seven days.  The function returns a list of these reports.
* Calls verify_reports to test whether filings flagged for download by
    consume_rss already have been downloaded.  If so, the function
    verifies the length of the downloaded file matches the length of
    the file posted on the FEC website.  When the lengths do not match,
    the saved file is deleted and retained in the download list.
* Uses multiprocessing and calls download_report to download each
    report returned by verify_reports.  After downloading a report, the
    subroutine compares the length of the downloaded file with the length
    of the source file.  If the lengths do not match, the file is deleted
    from the file system. The subroutine tries to download a file up to
    five times.  
    __NOTE:__ You can set the NUMPROC variable in the user variables section
    to specify the number of downloads that occur simultaneously. The
    default value is 10.

### Modifying the zipinfo Pickle
Here is the commented-out code available in the download_reports module
that you can use to manually control the zipinfo.p pickle if you don't
want to download all available archives back to 2001:

```python
    # Set mostrecent to the last date you DON'T want, so if you want
    # everything since Jan. 1, 2013, set mostrecent to: '20121231.zip'
    zipinfo['mostrecent'] = '20121231.zip' # YYYYMMDD.zip
    zipinfo['badfiles'] = [] # You probably want to leave this blank
```

## parse_reports Module
This module is the workhorse of the Toolbox.  It parses all downloaded
reports in a specified directory and saves child rows for each subform
type into a single data file for easy import into a database manager.

One of the main challenges with parsing electronically filed reports is
that each form <span>&mdash;</span> presently there are 56 <span>&mdash;</span> has its own column
headers.  What's more, the layout of each form has been through as many
as 13 iterations, each of which also can have its own headers.

The parse_reports module handles this by examining the two header rows
atop each electronically filed report to determine the form type and
version of that report.  (The current version is 8.1.)  If the form
type and version are supported by the parser, the columns in each data
row are mapped to standardized columns.  Generally speaking, the
standardized column headings largely mimic a form's version 8.0
headings, though a few legacy columns have been retained.

You can modify the standardized columns at any time by manipulating the
__outputhdrs__ variable.  All data for any columns not included in this
variable are dropped from the data stream and are not included in the
output files. The headers for each version of each form type are housed
in the __filehdrs__ variable in this format:

```python
[[formtype-1, [[[versions], [headers]], [[versions], [headers]], [[versions], [headers]]]],
[formtype-2, [[[versions], [headers]], [[versions], [headers]], [[versions], [headers]]]],
...
[formtype-n, [[[versions], [headers]], [[versions], [headers]], [[versions], [headers]]]]]
```

While all child rows are parsed and saved to delimited text files, the
two header rows for each file are loaded into a database manager.  By
default, the database manager is SQL Server, and the module calls a
series of stored procedures to load the header rows into the database.  
However, you can easily modify this behavior to use a different
database manager or save the header rows to their own text files.

The main reason to use the module to load the headers is the database
manager can verify each report is not already in the database.  
Eventually, I will add my database structure and stored procedure code
to this repository to make it easier to port the functionality to
interact with other database managers.

The parser supports the following form types:
* Form 1, Statement of Organization: Includes Form1S and Text records
* Form 3, Report of Receipts and Disbursements:  Filed by Congressional
candidates; includes all schedules and Text records.
* Form 3L, Report of Contributions Bundled by
Lobbyists/Registrants:  Includes all schedules and Text records.
* Form 3P, Report of Receipts and Disbursements: Filed by presidential
and vice-presidential candidates; includes all schedules and Text
records.
* Form 3X, Report of Receipts and Disbursements: Filed by all
committees other than the principal campaign committees of
Congressional, presidential and vice-presidential candidates; includes
all schedules and Text records.

Reports not recognized by parse_reports are moved to the directory
specified by the RPTHOLDDIR variable.

This module goes through the following process in this order:
* Calls build_list_of_supported_report_types, which examines the list
    housed in the filehdrs variable to determine which types of
    electronically filed reports can be parsed by the module.
* Calls create_file_timestamp, which creates a timestamp string that is
    affixed to the filename of each data file generated by the module.
* Creates an output file for each type of child row data <span>&mdash;</span> one for
    Schedule A, one for Schedule B, one for Text and so on <span>&mdash;</span> and
    writes the column headers to each file.  These files are saved in
    the directory specified by RPTOUTDIR.  The module also generates an
    "Other Data" file, where rows the module can't write to other data
    files are saved.
* Appends various full name fields to header lists.  These fields were
    used in older electronic filings until the FEC decided to split
    names across multiple fields.  These extra headers are appended
    here because the module attempts to parse these names and does not
    write the full name fields to the output data files.  If a name
    can't be parsed, it is saved to the appropriate last name field.

From this point, the module iterates over each electronic filing saved
in the directory specified by RPTSVDIR.  For each file, the module:
* Saves the six-digit filename as ImageID.  This value is prepended to
    every child row so those rows can be mapped to the parent header
    row.
* If the ImageID is contained in BADREPORTS, the module moves the file
    to the directory specified by RPTHOLDDIR, then proceeds to the next
    electronic filing.
* Extracts the file header.  The file header contains basic information
    about the file, such as the header version, the software used to
    generate the report, the delimiter used for names and a date format
    string.  For most forms, this information is constrained to the
    first line of the file.  But header versions 1 and 2 for all form
    types use multi-line file headers.  When a multi-line file header
    is detected, the module scans from the top of the file until it
    finds and reads the entire header.
* Extracts the report header, which is always contained on only one
    line, immediately below the file header.
* Checks to see whether the default delimiter specified by DELIMITER
    can be found anywhere in the file header. If not, the default
    delimiter is changed to a comma.
* Extracts the report type (i.e., F3PA, F3XN, F3T) and an abbreviated
    report type (i.e., F3P, F3X, F3) from the report header. The last
    letter of a Form 3 report type indicates whether the report is a
    New, Amended or Termination report. If the module does not support
    that report type, it moves the file to the RPTHOLDDIR and proceeds
    to the next electronic filing.
* Extracts the version number from the file header.
* Parses the file header. Custom code is used for header versions 1 and
    2 while the parse_data_row function is used for all later,
    single-line headers.
* Creates a dictionary to house data for the report header, adds a
    key for each column, then calls parse_data_row for all versions.
* If for some reason the delimiter used for names is unknown, the
    module attempts to determine the delimiter.
* Calls a custom function for each form type to validate the report
    header data, then calls load_report_header to load that data into a
    database manager.  If the data can't be validated, the module will
    fail. If the data is valid but can't be loaded into the database
    (either because of an error or because the report already exists in
    the database) the module moves the file to the directory specified\
    by RPTRVWDIR and proceeds to the next electronic filing.

As noted elsewhere, FEC Scraper Toolbox uses SQL Server as the default
database manager and uses stored procedures to interact with the
database.  However, this is an issue only in terms of loading header
data.  All other data is saved to delimited text files you can load
into any database manager. (The default delimiter is a tab, which you
can change by setting the OUTPUTDELIMITER variable.)

The main reason to load the headers from within the Python module is to
verify an electronic report does not already exist in the database.  
It also ensures a valid parent-child relationship exists before any
child rows are loaded.  Saving all data, including file headers, to
flat files so all the data can be imported in one set would be faster,
but querying the database and adding a header one report at a time is a
trade-off to ensure database viability.

Once the header has been parsed and loaded into the database, the
module creates a list to hold each type of child row (one file for
Schedule A data, one for Schedule B data and so on). The module then
iterates over the file, skipping the headers, and processes each child
row as follows:
* The module removes double spaces from the data. If OUTPUTDELIMITER is
    set to a tab, the module also converts tabs to spaces.
* The data row is converted to a list.
* The module looks at the first element of the list to determine the
    row's form type. If the type can't be determined, the row is
    written to the "Other Data" file.
* The module calls populate_data_row_dict to build a dictionary to
    house the output data, mapping the version-specific headers of the
    data row to the headers used in the data output file.
* The module calls a form type-specific function to validate and clean
    the data.
* Full name fields, if any, are removed from the data row.
* The module calls build_data_row to convert the dictionary to a list.
* The list is appended to the list created to house that type of data.

Once the module has finished iterating over the data for an electronic
report, each line of each form type-specific list is converted to a
delimited string and written to the appropriate data file before the
module proceeds to the next file.

At the end of the module, you'll see a call to a SQL Server stored
procedure called usp_DeactivateOverlappingReports. (Again, I plan to
post all my SQL Server code in this repository very soon.) Briefly,
this stored procedure addresses the problem of reports with different
but overlapping date ranges.  Rather than delete amended reports, I use
database triggers to flag the most recent report as Active and to
deactivate all earlier reports whenever the date ranges are exactly the
same.  But there are dozens and perhaps hundreds of cases where reports
with different date ranges overlap.  This stored procedure addresses
this problem by scrubbing all headers in the database each time this
module is run.

## update_master_files Module
This module can be used to download and extract the weekly master files
housed on the [FEC website](http://www.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/ftpdet.shtml).  The FEC updates these files every Sunday
evening.

### Warehousing Master Files
By default, the update_master_files module archives the compressed
master files downloaded each week (but not the extracted data files).
  This was done to preserve the source data during development and
because the FEC overwrites the data each week.

To disable this behavior, set the value of the ARCHIVEFILES user
variable (see the user variables section near the top of the module) to
zero. When ARCHIVEFILES is set to any value other than one (1), the
master files are not archived.

### How the update_master_files Module Works
This module goes through the following process in this order:
* Calls delete_data to remove all .txt and .zip files from the working
    directory specified by the MASTERDIR variable. (The .zip files from the
    previous week will be in this directory only if they were not
    archived the week before.)
* Uses multiprocessing and calls download_file to download each master
    file specified by the MASTERFILES user variable. (By default, all nine
    master files are downloaded.) These files are saved in the directory
    specified by the MASTERDIR variable.  
    After downloading a file, the subroutine compares the length of the
    downloaded file with the length of the source file of the FEC
    website.  If the lengths do not match, the file is deleted from the
    file system. The subroutine tries to download a file up to five times.  
    __NOTE:__ You can set the NUMPROC variable in the user variables section
    to specify the number of downloads that occur simultaneously.  The
    default value is 10.
* Uses multiprocessing and calls unzip_master_file to extract the data
    files from each master file.  If the extracted filename does not
    include a year reference, the subroutine appends a two-digit year.  
    __NOTE:__ You can set the NUMPROC variable in the user variables section
    to specify the number of downloads that occur simultaneously.  The
    default value is 10.
* When the ARCHIVEFILES user variable is set to 1, the module calls the
    archive_master_files subroutine, which creates a YYYYMMDD directory for
    the most recent Sunday date (if that directory does not already exist)
    and moves all .zip files in the MASTERDIR directory to the new
    directory.

### About the Master Files
The FEC recreates the master files every Sunday evening, overwriting
the master files posted the week before. The archive filenames include
a two-digit year to identify the election cycle, but the files housed
in those archives often do not. For that reason, this module appends a
two-digit election cycle to extracted filenames that do not include a year
reference.

There are nine compressed files for each election cycle. You can click
the links below to view the data dictionary for a particular file:
* __add:__ [New Individual Contributions](http://www.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/metadata/DataDictionaryContributionsbyIndividualsAdditions.shtml)
    Lists all contributions added to the master Individuals file in the
    past week.  
    Files extracted from these archives are named addYYYY.txt.
* __ccl:__ [Candidate Committee Linkage](http://www.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/metadata/DataDictionaryCandCmteLinkage.shtml)  
    Houses all links between candidates and committees that have
    been reported to the FEC. Strangely, this file does not include
    candidate ties to Leadership PACs, which are reported on Form 1.  
    Files extracted from these archives are named ccl.txt.
* __changes:__ [Individual Contribution Changes](http://www.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/metadata/DataDictionaryContributionsbyIndividualsChanges.shtml)
    Lists all transactions in the master Individuals file that have been
    changed during the past month.  
    Files extracted from these archives are
    named chgYYYY.txt.
* __cm:__ [Committee Master File](http://www.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/metadata/DataDictionaryCommitteeMaster.shtml)  
    Lists all committees registered with the FEC for a
    specific election cycle. Among other information, you can use this file
    to see a committee's FEC ID, name, address and treasurer. You can use
    the Committee Designation field (CMTE_DSGN) to find a specific
    committee type (such as principal campaign committees, joint
    fundraisers, lobbyist PACs and leadership pacs). Additionally, you can
    look for code O in the Committee Type field (CMTE_TP) to identify
    independent expenditure only committees commonly known as Super PACs.  
    Files extracted from these archives are named cm.txt.
* __cn:__ [Candidate Master File](http://www.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/metadata/DataDictionaryCandidateMaster.shtml)
    Lists all candidates registered with the FEC for a
    specific election cycle. You can use this file to see all candidates
    who have filed to run for a particular seat as well as information
    about their political parties, addresses, treasurers and FEC IDs.  
    Files extracted from these archives are named cn.txt.
* __delete:__ [Deleted Individual Contributions](http://www.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/metadata/DataDictionaryContributionsbyIndividualsDeletes.shtml)
    Lists all contributions deleted from the master Individuals file in the
    past week.  
    Files extracted from these archives are named delYYYY.txt.
* __indiv:__ [Individual Contributions](http://www.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/metadata/DataDictionaryContributionsbyIndividuals.shtml)
    For the most part, lists all itemized contributions of $200 or more
    made by INDIVIDUALS to any committee during the election cycle. Does
    not include most contributions from businesses, PACs and other
    organizations.  
    Files extracted from these archives are named itcont.txt.
* __oth:__ [Committee-to-Committee Transactions](http://www.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/metadata/DataDictionaryCommitteetoCommittee.shtml)
    Lists contributions and independent expenditures made by one committee
    to another.  
    Files extracted from these archives are named itoth.txt.
* __pas2:__ [Committee-to-Candidate Transactions](http://www.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/metadata/DataDictionaryContributionstoCandidates.shtml)
    Lists contributions made by a committee to a candidate.  
    Files extracted from these archives are named itpas2.txt.

### Using the indiv, add, changes and delete files
The indiv file generated every Sunday for each election cycle is
comprehensive, meaning it is a current (as of that Sunday) snapshot of
all individual contributions currently in the database.  Many users
simply drop and recreate this table every week.  If you do this, you do
not need the add, changes and delete files.  The FEC generates these
files to provide an alternative to rebuilding the indiv table each
week simply because of the sheer volume of data it houses.

I presently don't use any of these files and instead rely on the raw
filings themselves, which are immediately available on the FEC website
once they're filed and contain more data that the indiv files.  But
many journalists I know who do use these files say they just rebuild
the indiv table each week because it's easier and less error-prone than
trying to patch it each week.

If you decide to use the add, changes and delete files rather than
rebuild the indiv table each week, just be aware that if you ever miss
a weekly download, you will have to rebuild the indiv table.

## Next Steps
I house all of my campaign-finance data in a SQL Server database and
tend to use SQL Server Integration Services packages to load the data
generated/extracted by the FEC Scraper Toolbox.  I do this because of
the sheer volume of the data (The table housing all Schedule A data,
for example, contains more than 120 million rows so far.) and because I
can use SSIS to bulk load the data rather than load it from Python a
row at a time.

The lone exception is the parse_reports module.  That module attempts
to load a report's header row into the database to test whether that
report previously has been loaded.  All child rows in new reports are
parsed and moved to separate data files (one for Schedule A, one for
Schedule B and so on).

Understandably, the lack of code to load the data makes the Toolbox
less attractive to some potential users, who must manually import the
data files or develop their own Pythonic means of doing so.  
Nevertheless, the modules presently provide very fast and efficient
means of downloading massive quantities of data, managing that data and
preparing it for import.

At some point, I plan to develop Python functions to handle the data
imports, and of course I welcome any contributions from the open-source
community. I also plan to open source my entire database design so
others can recreate it in any database manager they choose.

Stay tuned!
