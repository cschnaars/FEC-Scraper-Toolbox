# Download zipped FEC master files
# By Christopher Schnaars, USA TODAY
# Developed with Python 2.7.4
# See README.md for complete documentation

# WARNING:
# --------
# If you automate the execution of this script, you should set it to
# run in the late evening to make sure you don't download any master
# files before the FEC has a chance to update them. At the time of this
# writing, the FEC was updating the candidate, committee and
# candidate-committee linkage files daily around 7:30 a.m. while
# other weekly files were updated a little before 4 p.m. on Sundays.

# Development Notes:
# ------------------
# 4/7/2014: Updated code so files can be downloaded daily. The FEC began
# publishing daily updates to the candidate, committee and
# candidate-committee linkage files. Other master files continue
# to be updated weekly.
